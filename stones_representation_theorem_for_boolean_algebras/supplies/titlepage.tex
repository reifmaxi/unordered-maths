    In this paper, we are going to work out
    Stone's Representation Theorem for Boolean Algebras
    that links Boolean algebras to certain topological spaces.
    To this end,
    we follow \emph{Einf√ºhrung in die Verbandstheorie}
    \cite{hermes:verbandstheorie-2}
    and introduce bounded, distributive, and complementary lattices
    to define Boolean algebras in the first place.
    The representation theorems we are looking for
    are then obtained from the book \emph{Introduction to Boolean Algebras}
    \cite{halmos:boolean_algebras}.
